<div id="content"><h1>Double Lift</h1><p>The double lift is a move used to appear to show the first (top) card, when actually you are showing the second card.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a thumb break underneath the second card (so, two cards on top of it).</li>
<li>Push the cards together is such a way as to make it look like you have only one card, using any grip you wish.</li>
<li>Lift up the top two cards as one, making sure to have control over every edge.</li>
<li>Et voila!</li>
</ol>
