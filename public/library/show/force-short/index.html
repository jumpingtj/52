<div id="content"><h1>The Forced Card... Twice</h1><p>A very simple control and force.</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer the spectator to fairly choose any card.</li>
<li>Place it back on top (or do a control like <a onclick='alert(&#34;Place the card in the deck, with roughly 5cm sticking out, then push it in, injogging it. You may now cut there.&#34;);'>CC</a>).</li>
<li>Do a false riffle shuffle, preserving the top card (or any control shuffle; I just find that the riffle works the best).</li>
<li>Let you spectator touch any card. Then square up the deck, with that card sticking out; turn your hand and pull off the top card.</li>
<li>They have just chosen their own card!</li>
</ol>
