title: "Double Lift"
---

The double lift is a move used to appear to show the first (top) card, when actually you are showing the second card.

1. Get a thumb break underneath the second card (so, two cards on top of it).
2. Push the cards together is such a way as to make it look like you have only one card, using any grip you wish.
3. Lift up the top two cards as one, making sure to have control over every edge.
4. Et voila!
