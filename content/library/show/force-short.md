title: "The Forced Card... Twice"
---

A very simple control and force.

1. Offer the spectator to fairly choose any card.
2. Place it back on top (or do a control like {{<popup name="CC" text="Place the card in the deck, with roughly 5cm sticking out, then push it in, injogging it. You may now cut there.">}}).
3. Do a false riffle shuffle, preserving the top card (or any control shuffle; I just find that the riffle works the best).
4. Let you spectator touch any card. Then square up the deck, with that card sticking out; turn your hand and pull off the top card.
5. They have just chosen their own card!
