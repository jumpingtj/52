# [Double Lift](/library/sleight/double-lift/) Reveal

An amazing sleight of hand ending for if the card is on top! (made by Toby!)

1. Make sure the card is at the top (if you are nervous, do a riffle to check; this will also help with the thumb break) and prepare for a double lift.
2. Do a double lift and show the face (of the second card). Say, "This is not your card, correct?" The spectator shall agree with you.
3. Place the two cards back on top and then put the top card (their card) on the table, saying, "so we shall place it on the table".
4. Now do another double lift, show the face and place them back on top, saying, "I don't think this is your card, either." Next, turn the deck over. Push the now-bottom card inwards slightly, allowing access to the card you just showed. Slide it off and place it, face up, on top of the deck.
5. Turning the deck back over, announce, "This next card, however, I believe shall be yours." Turn it over to reveal the card that you supposedly put on the table before. Turn over the tabled card, showing their card, and leave them stumped as to how you magically transported their card.
